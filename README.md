>in this we have dropped three parameters and achieved a accuracy of 95%+ and also we have a flask api to call or compile the model and give us the output regarding the our input values this can be done by simple curl command and by postman also just run <br>
>api.py it will compile the model_final.h5<br>
>if anybody wants to see the code for training the model he can see collab link given above<br>
>this api basically predicts the AQI under the following given conditions <br>
>'PM2.5', 'PM10', 'NO', 'NO2', 'NOx', 'NH3', 'CO', 'SO2', 'Toluene'<br>
>when u provide the model with this in a json type this will predict the aqi <br>
>the dataset we got has four chanbers two city one and rwo station one so we have combined the dataset and also used data fitting and removig the exta or empty rows amking it more effcient in its own manner <br>
>the manner for input must be same<br>
